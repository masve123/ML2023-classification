# Muffin vs Chihuahua Image Classification

## Project Overview

This project involves the binary classification of images to distinguish between muffins and Chihuahuas using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project explores different architectures and hyperparameter tuning using 5-fold cross-validation to optimize model performance.

### Repository Structure

- Muffin_vs_Chihuahua_Classification.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
- Report.pdf: A detailed report discussing the methodology, model architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and results.

### Running the project
The .ipynb file is already run, so the results should already be included. If for some reason the notebook needs to be run, this is the procedure:

#### Using Google Colab
1. Upload the Notebook:
Upload the Muffin_vs_Chihuahua_Classification.ipynb file to your Google Drive.

2. Open with Colab:
Open the notebook with Google Colab by right-clicking the file in Google Drive and selecting "Open with > Google Colaboratory".

3. Run the Notebook:
Execute the cells sequentially in Colab. Ensure you select a GPU runtime for faster training. This can be done by going to Runtime > Change runtime type and selecting GPU under Hardware accelerator.
